Bartholomew JoJo "Bart" Simpson (born April 1 ,1979 or February 23, 1979) is the mischievous, rebellious, misunderstood,
 disruptive and "potentially dangerous" oldest child of the Simpson family in The Simpsons. He is the only son of Homer
 and Marge Simpson, and the older brother of Lisa and Maggie. He also has been nicknamed "Cosmo", after discovering
 a comet in "Bart's Comet". Bart has also been on the cover on numerous comics, such as "Critical Hit",
 "Simpsons Treasure Trove #11", and "Winter Wingding". Bart also has a 100-issue comic series entitled
 the Simpson Comics Presents Bart Simpson. Bart is loosely based on Matt Groening and his older brother, Mark Groening.

Even at a young age, Bart has accomplished many feats. He has won an award for his Angry Dad web series[7],
he has discovered a new comet which was named after him[8], and he also has performed in a successful band with
 Milhouse Van Houten, Nelson Muntz, and Ralph Wiggum.[9]


Selma adopted Ling in Beijing, China after discovering that she had reached menopause. She lied about being married
to Homer Simpson, in order to fool the local authorities into thinking that Ling would be part of a traditional
family as opposed to a single mother. Though she and Jacqueline Bouvier have only been seen once together,
Jacqueline is her adopted grandmother. It's later revealed in "Changing of the Guardian" that Selma and Patty push
her to her limit in numerous hobbies and fail to praise her.
It's unknown who her biological parents are, nor is it known if they're alive or deceased. She also has diabetes,
 which she was more than likely born with.
